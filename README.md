Banknote Authentication using Logistic Regression


The aim of this question is to build a binary classification system mainly banknote authentication using logistic regression.

Banknote authentication is an important task and since it is difficult to detect it manually we can use Machine Learning Algorithms to solve 	the problem. 
We used Logistic Regression to verify if banknote is authentic or not with an average accuracy of 98% .
The loss function converged to a smooth line in all the cases.
